                <h2>Why We Need Chatbot?</h2>
                <p>
                    Technology is revolutionizing the way companies view customer service and collect data. One particular revolution has been the usage of chatbots, which has become more frequent among major and developing companies and is increasingly indispensable to their operations and daily business. Chatbots can provide proactive customer interaction immediately and at any time of the day. For businesses with limited manpower or resources, chatbots are a great tool in helping to collect feedback and provide customer service.Chatbots are also able to improve productivity and workflows in companies, allowing human agents to handle the more difficult tasks, which require a personal touch that chatbots are unable to.

                <h2>Will Chatbot Replace Human?</h2>
                <p>
                    Chatbots and automation are unable to replace humans as they lack the trust, empathy, and compassion which are necessary for customer service. Simply put, chatbots are designed to complement the call agent’s tasks and make their lives easier. However, at the end of the day, humans are still very much needed to supervise, monitor, and take over from the chatbots in the event where it is unable to meet the customer’s needs. Companies that will succeed are the ones that can find the right complement of skills between artificial intelligence and humans, utilizing them to the best of their abilities
